# password-generator

## Description
In this project added code to javascript. I added a function to to generate button to make a random password. I had it randomize a series of characters that include uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and special characters. I wrote a var for each of them made a string to include all the possible choices of each var. After selecting which characters you want in your password it will generate a password only including the charactes you chose.
